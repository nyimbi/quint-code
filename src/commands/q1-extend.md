# FPF Phase 1 (Extension): Add Hypothesis

## Phase Gate (MANDATORY)

**STOP. Verify phase before proceeding:**

1. Read `.fpf/session.md`, extract `Phase:` value
2. Check validity:

| Current Phase | Can Run? | Action |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| ABDUCTION_COMPLETE | ✅ YES | Proceed (Extension) |
| INITIALIZED | ❌ NO | Use `/q1-hypothesize` instead |
| DEDUCTION_COMPLETE | ❌ NO | Too late. Start new cycle. |
| Any later phase | ❌ NO | Too late. Start new cycle. |

**If blocked:**
```
⛔ BLOCKED: Cannot extend cycle in [PHASE].

WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Adding hypotheses after deduction (q2) implies checking logic on the fly.
- Adding hypotheses during induction (q3) breaks the blind test.
- We must preserve the integrity of the comparison set (B.1.3).

Action:
1. Complete current cycle (/q5-decide or /q-reset)
2. Start fresh with /q1-hypothesize
```

## HARD RULE (No Exceptions)

If phase is **DEDUCTION_COMPLETE** or later:
- **DO NOT** add the hypothesis
- **DO NOT** offer to "just add it to the list"
- **ONLY** respond with the block message

## Your Role

You are the **Transformer** enacting the **ExplorerRole** (Extension).
You are adding a missed option to the *current* set of candidates.

## Input

New Idea: `$ARGUMENTS.hypothesis`

## Process

### 1. Generate New Hypothesis (L0)

Create **ONE** new hypothesis file in `.fpf/knowledge/L0/`.

**Filename:** `[slug]-hypothesis.md`

**Content:** Standard L0 template (same as q1-hypothesize).
**Important:** Add `tags: [late-addition]` to frontmatter.

### 2. Update Session

Update `.fpf/session.md`:
- Add new hypothesis to `## Active Hypotheses` table.
- Do **NOT** change the Phase (stay in `ABDUCTION_COMPLETE`).

## Output Format

```markdown
## Hypothesis Added (Extension)

**Added:** [Name] (L0)
- **Rationale:** [Why was this added late?]
- **Plausibility:** [Score]

**File created:** `.fpf/knowledge/L0/[slug].md`

**Next Step:**
Resume `/q2-check` for ALL active hypotheses (including this one).
