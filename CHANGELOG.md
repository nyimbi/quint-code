## [4.0.0] - 2025-12-17

### The Agentic Kernel Update

This release fundamentally restructures Quint Code to strictly adhere to the First Principles Framework (FPF) by establishing the MCP server as the authoritative kernel and transforming CLI commands into lightweight entry points for specialized Agents.

### Breaking Changes
- **Project Directory:** Renamed from `.fpf` to `.quint` to align with the project name.
- **Database Schema:** `quint.db` schema updated to enforce FPF invariants.
  - Added `scope` to `holons` table (Pattern A.2.6).
  - Added `assurance_level` and `carrier_ref` to `evidence` table (Patterns B.3, A.10).
- **Command Architecture:** Commands (`/q1`, `/q2`, etc.) no longer contain agent prompts. They now strictly perform a `quint_transition` and instruct the LLM to adopt a persona defined in `.quint/agents/`.

### Added
- **Formal Agent Definitions:**
  - Dedicated agent profiles in `src/agents/`: `abductor.md`, `deductor.md`, `inductor.md`, `decider.md`, `auditor.md`.
  - Agents now have explicit instructions on how to use MCP tools to satisfy FPF obligations.
- **MCP Tooling Enhancements:**
  - **`quint_transition`:** Replaces ad-hoc phase changes. Requires `role`, `target` phase, and `evidence_stub` to validate the transition.
  - **`quint_propose`:** Now requires `scope` (Claim Scope/G) to prevent scope drift.
  - **`quint_evidence`:** Now requires `assurance_level` (L0/L1/L2) and `carrier_ref` (Symbol Carrier) to prevent trust inflation and hearsay.
  - **`quint_loopback`:** Explicit tool for the Induction -> Deduction refinement cycle.
- **Migration Utility:**
  - **`/q-actualize`:** New command to migrate legacy `.fpf` projects to `.quint` structure and schema.

### Changed
- **Evidence Graph Referring (A.10):** Evidence must now be anchored to a physical file or log (`carrier_ref`). The system no longer accepts "I checked it" as valid evidence; it demands "I checked file X".
- **Trust & Assurance (B.3):** Verdicts are no longer binary (PASS/FAIL). They are now graded by Assurance Level (L0=Unsubstantiated, L1=Substantiated, L2=Axiomatic/Validated).
- **Unified Scope Mechanism (A.2.6):** Hypotheses cannot be proposed without an explicit Context Slice (Scope).
- **Installer:** `install.sh` now sources agents from `src/agents`.

### Fixed
- **Role Spoofing:** `quint_transition` enforces that the `role` matches the valid actors for the current phase.
- **Logic Gaps:** The **Deductor** agent is now explicitly responsible for deriving "Necessary Consequences" before testing begins.
- **Hypothesis Zombie State:** The **Auditor** agent includes checks for orphaned L0 hypotheses.

## [3.4.0] - 2025-12-15

### Security: Executable Phase Gating

#### Physics-First Enforcement (`/q1-hypothesize`)
- **Vulnerability Closed:** Previous prompts used "soft" text instructions to prevent adding hypotheses mid-cycle, which "helpful" AI models would bypass.
- **Executable Gate:** Now injects a bash script that checks `.quint/session.md`. If the phase is locked (Deduction/Induction complete), the script exits with `1`.
- **Hard Stop:** The prompt explicitly instructs the AI to treat a script failure as a hard stop ("Physics says no"), preventing "helpfulness bias" overrides.

## [3.3.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added: Legacy Project Repair

#### Smart Initialization (`/q0-init`)
- **Self-Healing Capability:** The init command now detects incomplete FPF setups (e.g., legacy projects missing `context.md` from v2.x).
- **Deterministic Diagnostic:** Injects a bash script to verify file existence before deciding actions, preventing AI "hallucinated" skips.
- **Repair Mode:** If `.quint/` exists but is incomplete, it triggers a surgical repair (generating only missing files) while preserving existing session data.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added: Process Hardening & Flexibility

#### Strict Phase Gating (FPF Integrity)
- **Hard Block in `/q1-hypothesize`:** Explicitly forbids generating new hypotheses if the cycle has passed Deduction. This prevents the "Helpfulness Bias" vulnerability where AI assistants might break process integrity to be "nice".
- **Conditional Logic in `/q2-check`:** The cycle phase now only advances to `DEDUCTION_COMPLETE` when *all* active L0 hypotheses are resolved. If any remain unchecked, the door stays open for extensions.

#### New Command: `/q1-extend`
- **Legitimate Extension Path:** A dedicated command to add a missed hypothesis during the `ABDUCTION_COMPLETE` phase.
- **Safety Rails:** Strictly blocked once `DEDUCTION_COMPLETE` is reached, ensuring evidence integrity (WLNK validity) during testing.

### Changed
- **Updated `/q-status`:** State machine visualization now includes the `(q1-extend)` loop.
- **Refined `/q3-test` & `/q3-research`:** Reinforced checks to ensure testing only happens after deduction is fully complete.

## [3.1.0] - 2025-12-14

### Added: Deep Reasoning Capabilities

#### Context Slicing (A.2.6)
- **Structured Context:** `.quint/context.md` is now structured into explicit slices:
  - **Slice: Grounding** (Infrastructure, Region)
  - **Slice: Tech Stack** (Language, Frameworks)
  - **Slice: Constraints** (Compliance, Budget, Team)
- **Context-Aware Init:** `/q0-init` now scans `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, etc., to auto-populate slices.

#### Explicit Role Injection (A.2)
- **Role-Swapping Prompts:** Commands now enforce specific FPF roles to prevent "AI drift":
  - `/q1-hypothesize`: **ExplorerRole** (Creative, Abductive)
  - `/q2-check`: **LogicianRole** (Strict, Deductive)
  - `/q4-audit`: **AuditorRole** (Adversarial, Normative)

#### Context Drift Analysis
- **New Audit Step:** `/q4-audit` now includes a mandatory **Context Drift Check**.
- **Validation:** Verifies that hypotheses generated in step 1 still match the constraints in step 4 (preventing "works on my machine" architecture).

### Changed
- **Command Prompts:** Updated `q0`, `q1`, `q2`, `q4` to enforce the new reasoning standards.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-12-14

### Major Breaking Change: Rebrand to Quint Code

**Crucible Code is now Quint Code.**

### Why the Name Change?

1.  **Avoid Collision:** "Crucible" is an existing code review tool by Atlassian. We want a distinct identity.
2.  **Not Just Code:** This tool melts *ideas* and *reasoning*, not just source code.
3.  **The "Quintessence":** Anatoly Levenchuk described this project as a "distillate of FPF" (~5% of the full framework). It is the *quintessence*—the concentrated essence of the methodology.
4.  **The Invariant Quintet:** FPF is built on five invariants (IDEM, COMM, LOC, WLNK, MONO). Quint Code enforces a rigid 5-step sequence (`q1`–`q5`) to preserve these invariants in your reasoning.

### Changed

- **Project Name**: `crucible-code` → `quint-code`
- **Commands Prefix**: `/fpf-*` → `/q*`
  - `/q0-init`
  - `/q1-hypothesize`
  - `/q2-check`
  - `/q3-test`
  - `/q3-research`
  - `/q4-audit`
  - `/q5-decide`
- **Utility Commands**:
  - `/fpf-status` → `/q-status`
  - `/fpf-query` → `/q-query`
  - `/fpf-decay` → `/q-decay`
  - `/fpf-discard` → `/q-reset` (Renamed to avoid tab-completion clash with decay)

### Migration Guide

1. **Delete old commands**: Run the uninstall script or manually delete `~/.claude/commands/fpf-*`.
2. **Install new commands**: Run `./install.sh`.
3. **Update mental model**: Think "Quintet" (5 invariants, 5 steps).

This was the initial implementation based on the First Principles Framework (FPF) specification. The focus was on establishing the core workflow and making FPF accessible to developers through Claude Code commands.

Key design decisions:

- Commands over subagents (human must be in the loop)
- File-based persistence (git-trackable)
- Minimal tooling (no external dependencies)
- Advisory guidance (not enforced gates)

---

## Upgrade Notes

### 1.0.0 → 2.0.0

**Session file format changed.** Existing `.quint/session.md` files should be updated to include:

- Phase Transitions Log table
- Valid Phase Transitions diagram reference

**Evidence files should add:**

- `congruence:` block for external evidence
- `valid_until:` if not already present

**No breaking changes to:**

- Knowledge directory structure
- DRR format (only additions)
- Command names and basic arguments

**Recommended migration:**

1. Run `/fpf-decay` to identify evidence needing validity dates
2. Add congruence assessment to existing external evidence
3. No need to re-run completed cycles
