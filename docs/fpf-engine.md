# The FPF Engine

Quint Code implements the **First Principles Framework (FPF)** — a methodology for structured reasoning developed by [Anatoly Levenchuk](https://ailev.livejournal.com/).

## The ADI Cycle

The workflow follows the Canonical Reasoning Cycle (Pattern B.5), consisting of three inference modes:

### 1. Abduction (`/q1-hypothesize`)

**What:** Generate plausible, competing hypotheses.

**How it works:**
- You pose a problem or question
- The AI (as *Abductor* persona) generates 3-5 candidate explanations or solutions
- Each hypothesis is stored in `L0/` (unverified observations)
- No hypothesis is privileged — anchoring bias is the enemy

**Output:** Multiple L0 claims, each with:
- Clear statement of the hypothesis
- Initial reasoning for plausibility
- Identified assumptions and constraints

### 2. Deduction (`/q2-verify`)

**What:** Logically verify the hypotheses against constraints and typing.

**How it works:**
- The AI (as *Verifier* persona) checks each L0 hypothesis for:
  - Internal logical consistency
  - Compatibility with known constraints
  - Type correctness (does the solution fit the problem shape?)
- Hypotheses that pass are promoted to `L1/`
- Hypotheses that fail are moved to `invalid/` with explanation

**Output:** L1 claims (logically sound) or invalidation records.

### 3. Induction (`/q3-validate`)

**What:** Gather empirical evidence through tests or research.

**How it works:**
- For **internal** claims: run tests, measure performance, verify behavior
- For **external** claims: research documentation, benchmarks, case studies
- Evidence is attached with:
  - Source and date (for decay tracking)
  - Congruence rating (how well does external evidence match our context?)
- Claims that pass validation are promoted to `L2/`

**Output:** L2 claims (empirically verified) with evidence chain.

## Post-Cycle: Audit and Decision

### 4. Audit (`/q4-audit`)

Compute trust scores using:

- **WLNK (Weakest Link):** Assurance = min(evidence levels)
- **Congruence Check:** Is external evidence applicable to our context?
- **Bias Detection:** Are we anchoring on early hypotheses?

### 5. Decision (`/q5-decide`)

- Select the winning hypothesis
- Generate a **Design Rationale Record (DRR)** (Pattern E.9)
- DRR captures: decision, alternatives considered, evidence, and expiry conditions

## Commands Reference

| Command | Phase | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `/q0-init` | Setup | Initialize `.quint/` and record the Bounded Context. |
| `/q1-hypothesize` | Abduction | Generate L0 hypotheses for a problem. |
| `/q1-add` | Abduction | Manually add your own L0 hypothesis. |
| `/q2-verify` | Deduction | Verify logic and constraints, promoting claims from L0 to L1. |
| `/q3-validate` | Induction | Gather empirical evidence, promoting claims from L1 to L2. |
| `/q4-audit` | Audit | Run an assurance audit and calculate trust scores. |
| `/q5-decide` | Decision | Select the winning hypothesis and create a Design Rationale Record. |
| `/q-status` | Utility | Show the current state of the reasoning cycle. |
| `/q-query` | Utility | Search the project's knowledge base. |
| `/q-decay` | Maintenance | Check for and report expired evidence (Epistemic Debt). |
| `/q-actualize` | Maintenance | Reconcile the knowledge base with recent code changes. |
| `/q-reset` | Utility | Discard the current reasoning cycle. |

### New Maintenance Commands

#### /q-decay (Evidence Decay)
Over time, the evidence supporting your decisions can become stale. A benchmark from two years ago may not reflect the performance of a library today. This command implements the FPF principle of **Evidence Decay (B.3.4)**. It scans your evidence for expired `valid_until` dates and reports on the project's "Epistemic Debt"—the amount of risk you are carrying from outdated knowledge.

#### /q-actualize (Knowledge Reconciliation)
This command serves as the **Observe** phase of the FPF's **Canonical Evolution Loop (B.4)**. It reconciles your documented knowledge with the current state of the codebase by:
1.  **Detecting Context Drift:** Checks if project files (like `package.json`) have changed, potentially making your `context.md` stale.
2.  **Finding Stale Evidence:** Finds evidence whose `carrier_ref` (the file it points to) has been modified in `git`.
3.  **Flagging Outdated Decisions:** Identifies decisions whose underlying evidence chain has been impacted by recent code changes.

## When to Use FPF

**Use it for:**
- Architectural decisions with long-term consequences
- Multiple viable approaches requiring systematic evaluation
- Decisions that need an auditable reasoning trail
- Building up project knowledge over time

**Skip it for:**
- Quick fixes with obvious solutions
- Easily reversible decisions
- Time-critical situations where the overhead isn't justified
